# Real_Time_Human_Detection_Tool_sb

This project provide a tool for detecting the Human with a simple real-time face detection using the popular libraries like Opencv and Haar cascade classifier.
Here Python script demonstrates real-time face detection with the use some of the well known libraries like Opencv and easy way to perform this code with pre-trained Haar cascade classifier. This code also contain code for capturing video frames from the default webcam and detecting the human and also labeled as "Face" in the frame display.

### Usage

1. This project will ensure to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system.
2. Run the script using the command `python face_detection.py`.
4. It need to install some wel known libraries which can be done by "pip install package name".
3. The webcam feed will open, and faces will be detected in real-time.
4. Press the 'a' or other identical key to exit the program.

### Requirements

- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

### Files

- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for detecting frontal faces which will be given in the files section

### Acknowledgments

The face detection algorithm is based on the Viola-Jones object detection framework. The Haar cascade classifier used in this script is provided by OpenCV.
